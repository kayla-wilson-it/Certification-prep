# AWS Cloud Practitioner Notes

- **Shared Responsibility Model**: AWS secures the cloud infrastructure; users secure their data and configurations.
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: Create users, groups, and roles with fine-grained permissions.
- **Core Services**:
  - EC2: Virtual servers
  - S3: Object storage
  - RDS: Managed relational databases
  - Lambda: Serverless compute
- **Cloud Economics**: Pay-as-you-go pricing, reserved instances, and cost optimization strategies.
- **Security Best Practices**: Use MFA, encryption, and least privilege access.
- **Global Infrastructure**: Regions, Availability Zones, and Edge Locations.
